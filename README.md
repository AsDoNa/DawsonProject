README

When viewing this project, please download the files and ensure that the pictures are placed in the same folder as the html is or else the pictures will not show up.
You can launch the website by pressing on the path with the html file in it in file explorer, copying it and pasting it in the browser and adding: dawsonProject.html
Links in the footer are interactive and can be pressed to go to that paragraph.
Please view this in chrome as I am unsure as to the compatability with other browsers.
This project can be viewed in fullscreen or out of fullscreen.
Links with the arrow out of the box take you to external sites
References are clickable.
Titles and references are tabbable.
I handcoded the website in Notepad++.
I have checked the length of the project (including titles, subtitles and content while excluding picture captions, bibliography and references) and it comes to exactly 2000 words.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.
